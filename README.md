Turns an Android phone into a pager for FRC Competitions

Scans notifications from Google Messages and parses any that follow a specified format.
It then (deterministically, no AI) creates a paragraph for a TTS to read, and then prompts the TTS to read it out loud

Designed to be used in FRC Competition enviorments where it is often impossible to get reliable wifi, data, bluetooth, wired, or any other connections (except from sms/mms)
